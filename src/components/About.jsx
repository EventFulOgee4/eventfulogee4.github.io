                        My name is Javad, I'm a curious and driven problem-solver studying Computer Science at the University of Calgary, 
                        with a strong focus on Machine Learning, Data Science, and Software Engineering. I love building intelligent systems, 
                        uncovering insights from data, and writing clean, effective code that creates real value.

                        From training machine learning models to analyzing complex data and developing full-stack applications, 
                        I thrive on projects that push me to think critically and grow.

                        I'm eager to keep evolving as an engineer and to collaborate on impactful projectsâ€”especially those that bring together 
                        data and smart technologies to address real-world challenges.
