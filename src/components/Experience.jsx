                    During my time as a Software Developer at Kapital Bank, I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects that contributed directly to the bankâ€™s 
                    digital infrastructure. I collaborated with a team of developers to design, implement, and maintain internal systems and customer-facing applications. 
                    My role involved writing clean, efficient code, debugging issues, and ensuring the reliability and performance of our software solutions. 
                    I gained hands-on experience with tools and technologies such as HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and ReactJS 
                    and strengthened my skills in agile development, teamwork, and problem-solving in a fast-paced environment.
